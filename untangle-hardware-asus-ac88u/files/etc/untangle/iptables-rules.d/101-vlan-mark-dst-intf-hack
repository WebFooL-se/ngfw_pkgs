# This scripts add a fake rule to mark the dest interface in cases where we failed to set the mark

# Because of bug #13076, we fail to set the mark when the session is going to the eth0.2 port in the br.eth0-2 bridge
# As such we add this rule to just assume its going to eth0.2

# If there is a br.eth0-2 bridge interface, add a rule to mark any packets going to this bridge which are unmarked
